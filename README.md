# OLED Click(tm) board

Playing with the OLED  ClickÂ© Board.

Need:

* Device: PIC16F1709 (or other PIC16F1 in 20-pin DIP)
* Board: PICDEM(tm) Low Pin Count + mikroBUS connector = [Simplicity](https://github.com/luciodj/Simplicity) 
* Debugger: PICkit(tm) 3

## The Basic Idea
1. Add a [MikroBUS](http://www.mikroe.com/mikrobus/) connector to the LPC board 
2. Connect an [OLED Click Board](http://www.mikroe.com/click/oled_B/) 
3. Launch MPLAB X and MPLAB Code Configurator to quickly initialise all the peripherals
4. Play ...


## Limitations
* Got lazy, did not complete the entire ASCII font ... wonna help!?
